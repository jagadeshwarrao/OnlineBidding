                a. Accuracy of Information: Users are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the item details provided during the process of adding an item. The Auction Online Management System does not verify the authenticity or quality of the items added by users.

                a. Schedule Changes: The timing, duration, or cancellation of future auctions may occur at the discretion of the auction organizers. The Auction Online Management System cannot be held responsible for any changes made after the information has been provided.
                
                b. Availability and Bidding: The inclusion of an item in the list of upcoming auctions does not guarantee its availability for bidding.
